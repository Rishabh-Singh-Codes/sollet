# Idea
A user wants to receive a gift/cryptocurrency/donation/payment (will be referred to as **gifts** going forward) from people directly on the platform they are on e.g., Twitter (X). To do this, they can create their own Blink and receive gifts. However, creating and hosting your own Blink is very tedious, backend tech-heavy, and time-consuming process. How do we solve this?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The user comes on our platform, and provides us with their basic details and the wallet in which they want to receive the payment and that's it. We will create and host the Blink on their behalf and we'll provide them with a link, which they share across the platforms.

<br />

> The user can create their own wallet as well, if they don't have one already.

#### What is a Blink?
Blink is an acronym for Blockchain + Link. These are links which unfurl into beautiful UIs that can be used to do any blockchain transaction directly on the platform. [Checkout this video](https://youtu.be/m_feBl0ROik?si=SwsT_zH6bgV7vC6P).
